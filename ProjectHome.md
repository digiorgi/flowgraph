Flowgraph is built to easily script plugins and use them.
You can just use the flowgraph plugins as I am with MIDI.
Or you could use the settings file(.fgs) in your own program. Then use flowgraph as an editor.

## 0.1.4 has been released! ##
(Mouse/Keyboard/Joystick has been disabled from this version.)
